// Collection API : Collection API is a set of classes and interfaces that are used to store and manipulate the group of objects. 

// collection : when taking about the collection it is interface which is used to store the group of the objects

// colletions : when taking about the collections then it is class which is used to store the group of the objects

// Collection API in Java
        // Collection is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.
        // Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.
        // Java Collection means a single unit of objects. Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).
        // Java Collection API provides a way to access prepackaged data structures as well as algorithms to manipulate them.
        // Java Collection API contains interfaces, implementations, and algorithms.
        // Java Collection API can be used to perform the following operations:
        // Searching
        // Sorting


// int num =5;
// int nums = new int[5];  // array of 5 elements 
// when we need to use the lifo then we use the stack
// when we need to use the fifo then we use the queue
